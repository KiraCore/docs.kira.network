Instead, it adopts a per-capita approach, ensuring that every vote carries equal weight, irrespective of the voter\'s stake. Within this system, Consensus nodes hold a foundational role by serving as the primary decision-makers. They form the initial group of Councilors, which defines any network participants endowed with the right to propose and vote on network decisions. Anyone can become a Councilor; the group is open to all users, contingent upon receiving endorsement from the existing council.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Backend---SEKAI/Overview":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Backend---SEKAI/Overview","title":"Overview","description":"SEKAI (\u4e16\u754c) is KIRA\'s core blockchain, managing all on-chain logic, including processing transactions and state transitions. SEKAI iterates upon Tendermint consensus with its own Multi-Bonded Proof of Stake (MBPoS), which enables the staking of multiple whitelisted assets as well as KEX, KIRA\u2019s native token and natively supported Liquid Staking Derivatives. Consensus Nodes, or \'validators,\' propose new states of SEKAI blockchain application derived from blocks that contain an ordered list of transactions carrying instructions (user requests). Those instructions are then executed by each full node following the SEKAI codebase which defines how to interpret and apply them.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Introduction":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"KIRA is a hypermodular network that supports execution of trustless, blockchain-less applications operating as L2 systems. It provides a programmable verification framework, allowing each application\'s execution validity to be verified through customizable consensus rules. While modular by design, KIRA consolidates the entire full-stack into one all-inclusive solution, avoiding the compounded complexity and risks associated with integrating across separate external systems. This unified stack provides the infrastructure, resources, data availability, sequencing, and shared security required by this new generation of trustless applications.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Layer-2/Building-on-KIRA":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Layer-2/Building-on-KIRA","title":"Building on KIRA","description":"Building on KIRA is intended to replicate classical Web2 design patterns where the developer creates a new REST-API project (server side) and pairs it with his frontend application (client side). The KIRA network acts as a decentralized middleware and infrastructure layer ensuring that applications are accessible and have the resources needed to run. As long the server application remains deterministic and can be re-executed or otherwise proven that execution happened in the expected way (e.g. by using a set of sequenced inputs, ZK proofs, or even AI) it is possible to trustlessly verify the execution and thus transition the application from one state of its database to another. Submitting state hashes of the application database into the KIRA base layer by the application leader elected in each session (database snapshot) allows for achieving consensus and thus for composability (value transfer and data communication) between the apps.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Layer-2/Overview":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Layer-2/Overview","title":"Overview","description":"KIRA\u2019s base layer (SEKAI) handles governance, token transfers, multi-staking, and all other system security-related on-chain logic. At the same time, SEKAI assists in the execution of decentralized applications taking place on their dedicated off-chain subnets by enabling their orchestration, communication, and settlement. This separation enables parallel scaling of execution, storage, and networking capabilities of each application. KIRA applications, also referred to as \u2018RollApps\u2019, consist of an execution container defining application logic, and a verification container defining how changes in the application state can be verified.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Layer-2/Virtual-Finality-Gadget":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Layer-2/Virtual-Finality-Gadget","title":"Virtual Finality Gadget","description":"The Virtual Finality Gadget (VFG) is a programmable finality mechanism that grants each application on KIRA the ability to establish its own verification and consensus rules. It divides application logic into execution (operated by Executors) and verification (overseen by Fishermen) components. VFG allows developers to customize their finality logic, such as choosing an optimistic model of execution (rollups - valid by default), pessimistic (rolldowns - invalid until verified), or any bespoke verification logic, even allowing for the creation of recursive appchains and human judgment by a defined set of network actors. VFG\u2019s ability to support non-deterministic verification binaries makes it particularly useful for complex, blockchain-less, Web2-scale applications, such as AI and gaming as well as makes it impossible for an attacker to predict if his attack attempt would be successful as the verification rules can be customized by each Fisherman individually.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Middleware---INTERX/Decentralized-API-Gateway":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Middleware---INTERX/Decentralized-API-Gateway","title":"Decentralized API Gateway","description":"A distinctive feature of INTERX is its functionality as a decentralized RPC gateway. This capability stems from its unique setup where each INTERX node, regardless of its associated subnet, is linked to a KIRA account address, with all responses being digitally signed. This architecture allows users to query multiple nodes simultaneously and evaluate the responses against each other. Such a mechanism enables users to identify nodes that consistently deliver precise responses and craft off-chain fraud proofs against nodes disseminating fraudulent or inconsistent data.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Middleware---INTERX/KIRA\u2019s-Approach-to-Data-Availability":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Middleware---INTERX/KIRA\u2019s-Approach-to-Data-Availability","title":"KIRA\u2019s Approach to Data Availability","description":"Traditional systems often treat all application data uniformly\u2014both user balances and arbitrary data\u2014 a method that compromises UX and practicality. This is particularly true when quick access to essential and trusted information, like user balances, is required during unexpected interruptions in the application\u2019s sequencing process (e.g. requests rate limiting). KIRA addresses this by clearly distinguishing these types of data. Specifically, user balances can be directly settled on SEKAI, KIRA\u2019s base layer, leveraging account abstraction. This arrangement allows Layer 2 applications to be treated similarly to user accounts, enabling them to perform on-chain actions such as issuing tokens, participating in governance, staking, and even communicating with other applications as if they were autonomous humans.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What-is-KIRA/Middleware---INTERX/Overview":{"id":"What-is-KIRA/Middleware---INTERX/Overview","title":"Overview","description":"INTERX (\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9) is KIRA\'s decentralized middleware service and is often referred to as KIRA\u2019s Content Availability Layer. It is responsible for node monitoring, peer discovery, response caching, proxy, load balancing, storage, sequencing, and propagation (targeted gossiping) of data and transactions between client-facing applications and KIRA\u2019s back-end services such as L2 apps or SEKAI.
