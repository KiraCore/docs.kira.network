In the case of "Rollups," state transitions that are attempted to be settled on the base layer are assumed to be by default correct unless evidence in the form of fraud proof is provided. In the case of "Rolldowns," state transitions that are attempted to be settled require a threshold of verifiers to accept them - for that reason, Rolldowns are sometimes referred to as "Pessimistic Rollups." In general, Rollup might be also referred to as an L2 or an independent network that uses a "pessimistic" or "optimistic" settlement with a larger base layer network (e.g., Ethereum) that it actively observes to gain access to tokens or otherwise communicate with other networks or applications. We might refer to such networks as sidechains, zones, and/or parachains. If such a network serves a very specific purpose, it might be also referred to as an "AppChain," or in other words, an Application Specific Blockchain. As of 2024, AppChains are an extinct concept, but you might come across them in various crypto-related literature and topics.
