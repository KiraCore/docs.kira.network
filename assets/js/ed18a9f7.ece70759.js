This document provides essential information on how to participate in the KIRA Testnet. KIRA focuses on testing its core functionalities, including decentralized infrastructure, a consensus network, and a data availability service. The testnet will undergo frequent updates and may experience instability as new features are integrated. We invite developers to contribute to the KIRA ecosystem and encourage users to explore its functionalities, helping us identify and resolve potential design and implementation issues. Node operators are also encouraged to participate by deploying and maintaining validator nodes to ensure network stability.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"run-a-consensus-node/account-recovery":{"id":"run-a-consensus-node/account-recovery","title":"Account Recovery","description":"You should never under any circumstances provide anyone with your private keys or mnemonic words. Keep them stored on a piece of paper offline and keep an online copy only on your validator node. It is also recommended to set up a recovery address that can be used to rotate your validator key in case you suspect that your node might have been compromised. You can learn more about that process from our public docs page.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"run-a-consensus-node/become-a-tester":{"id":"run-a-consensus-node/become-a-tester","title":"Become a tester","description":"To ensure our network\'s security, Sybil-resistance is essential. Therefore, all our testers undergo rigorous screening to verify their uniqueness. Our testers are not just testers; they are acknowledged as official KIRA Evangelists. This stasus provides them with benefits such as grants, bounties, potential validator seats, governance roles, and Universal Basic Income (UBI). They also gain access to the exclusive private testers chat and more.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"run-a-consensus-node/connecting-to-seed-nodes":{"id":"run-a-consensus-node/connecting-to-seed-nodes","title":"Connecting to Seed Nodes","description":"When connecting to a new network, it is important to pay attention to certain details to ensure that you are joining the correct chain. One of the key factors to consider is the number of peers in the network, as this can give you an idea in regards to the legitimacy of the chain (it is unlikely the attacker would be hosting hundreds of active nodes). In addition, it is crucial to verify both the Genesis Hash and network name to confirm that you are connecting to the intended chain. To find the hash of the genesis file, you can refer to the active testnet information page, which should provide all the necessary information to help you make an informed decision about joining the network.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"run-a-consensus-node/joining-validator-set":{"id":"run-a-consensus-node/joining-validator-set","title":"Joining Validator Set","description":"To join the validator set you will need to become an official KIRA tester first.
