Torii deployment is straightforward since all services can be deployed at once using **Docker Compose**. While each service can be deployed individually, this is the easiest way to get everything running. The next section covers individual deployments and API usage.


#### Clone the Repository {#1b9467da57b78065bdace8ae4e065758}


Start by cloning the Torii repository:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/KiraCore/torii.git
cd torii
```


#### Deploy {#1b9467da57b780d59496fee1545af595}


:::note

Ensure **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed before proceeding.

:::




Toriiâ€™s docker-compose.yml defines all services and their dependencies. From the root folder, run:


```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


This builds and starts all containers in detached mode.


#### Configuration {#1b9467da57b780fb92c3d2df58f93a9f}


Each service has a default **config.yml**, which works out of the box. However, these files can be modified if needed (e.g., adjusting keys, TSS settings, or endpoints). More details, as well as service API, are covered in the next section.


#### Verify Deployment {#1b9467da57b78063becdecbe6fa8b9cc}


To check logs and ensure services are running:


```shell
docker-compose logs -f
```


#### Useful Commands {#1b9467da57b780c78c32ec32106558de}

- **Stop all services:**

	```bash
	docker-compose down
	```

- **Restart all services:**

	```bash
	docker-compose restart
	```

- **View running containers:**

	```bash
	docker ps
	```


#### Interaction {#1b9467da57b780ff8286e7802e8308ad}


Once deployed, Torii can be used via its API endpoints. Refer to the Torii Services section for details on interacting with individual services.
