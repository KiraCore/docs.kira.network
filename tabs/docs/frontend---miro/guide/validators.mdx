The Validators page presents data about the whitelisted validators of the current network.


Validators can exhibit one of four statuses: `Active`, `Paused`, `Jailed`, or `Inactive`. It is also possible to verify if the Staking Pool feature is `enabled` for a validator.


On the Validators page, there is an option to mark specific validators as favorites using the hollow star icon on the right.


Each validator's position on the list includes an ℹ️ icon on the left, which allows for viewing of more detailed information about that specific validator.

Clicking the info icon will open the details of a specific validator. Different data can be checked here:

- generic info about validator: Status, Staking Pool status, Uptime and Streak
- Identity Registrar entries: Contact, Description, Social, etc.
- Staking pool details (this section can be used by users to stake tokens).
