## Overview  {#17f467da57b780f8a5e6f459bc1f3708}


Ethereum wallets, such as Metamask, rely on JSON-RPC to interact with blockchains, making them incompatible with Cosmos-based networks like KIRA, which use distinct transaction formats and APIs. To address this, KIRAâ€™s decentralized API, INTERX, translates Ethereum JSON-RPC queries into Cosmos-compatible formats, enabling Metamask to interact seamlessly with KIRA.


While INTERX supports reading blockchain data, handling Ethereum-signed transactions is more complex. These transactions require a mechanism to be "wrapped" in a Cosmos-compatible format. By encoding Ethereum transactions using protocol buffers (protobuf), they can be relayed and executed on the Cosmos chain without losing their original integrity or purpose.


The command `sekaid tx ethereum relay` creates a transaction on SEKAI (Cosmos-sdk based chain) that wraps an Ethereum transaction into a Cosmos-sdk compatible format for processing by SEKAI blockchain application.
