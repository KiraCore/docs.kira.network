Traditional Layer 1 blockchain networks like Ethereum use a complex, dynamic fee market determined by opcode prices and the computational "gas" consumed during transaction execution. In such a system, calculating the exact transaction cost can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Additionally, these opcode prices are deeply embedded within the protocol, typically requiring a network upgrade or hard fork for changes.


KIRA's approach replaces the conventional "gas" system with a governance-driven structure. Here, transaction fees are predefined for each type of transaction and uniformly denominated in `ukex`, simplifying and stabilizing the fee calculation. Additionally, the governance is tasked with setting failure fees for each transaction type and determining a specific timeout period for transactions. Complementing this streamlined fee structure, KIRA's [Token Rates Registrar](/docs/backend---sekai/modules/tokens-module/token-rates-registrar) allows fees to be paid in other whitelisted tokens at a rate defined by the governance. This mechanism ensures a clear and efficient conversion between `ukex` and other tokens, enhancing the network's flexibility and user accessibility.
