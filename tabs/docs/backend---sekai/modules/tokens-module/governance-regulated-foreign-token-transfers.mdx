## Overview  {#22e0f2d993a7488b885efa35c0b62983}


Foreign tokens can significantly impact the network's economy if they are stolen or originate from a compromised network (i.e. Luna). For instance, should a token experience sudden supply exploitation, it could pose a serious risk to the network's spam protection mechanism if used for fee payments. To mitigate this risk, KIRAâ€™s governance has the ability to create and manage blacklist and whitelist filters for foreign token transfers. These filters can be enabled or disabled through the `enable_token_whitelist` and `enable_token_blacklist` [network properties](/docs/backend---sekai/modules/governance/network-properties), and their contents are curated through dedicated governance proposals. In the event that a foreign network becomes compromised and its tokens are deposited into KIRA, these filters can be used to recover funds through a planned hard fork. This process is similar to funds recovery in other Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work chains, but offers on-chain signaling of the network governance's intentions.


### Filters Mechanism {#51d0ee0e8c8c41b8914df112534e1a22}


When the `enable_token_whitelist` network property is set to `true`, SEKAI will check whether a given token is whitelisted before allowing it to be transferred. Similarly, when the `enable_token_blacklist` network property is set to `true`, SEKAI will check whether a given token is blacklisted before allowing it to be transferred. These checks are performed during the `AnteHandler` phase of transaction processing.


If a token is not on the whitelist (in the case of `enable_token_whitelist` being set to `true`) or is on the blacklist (in the case of `enable_token_blacklist` being set to `true`), then the transaction will fail validation during the `AnteHandler` phase, and the transaction will not be broadcasted to the network or included in any block.

:::note

Each CLI command and proposal process in KIRA requires specific permissions. These permissions must be added to the account's whitelist or obtained as sudo permissions for direct changes. Refer to the [Roles & Permissions](/docs/backend---sekai/modules/governance/roles--permissions) documentation for more details.

:::note

`$SIGNER` represents the transaction signer's account name or address. For instructions on setting common flags as environment variables, such as `$FLAGS_TX` and `$FLAGS_QR`, see the [CLI Guide](/docs/backend---sekai/cli-guide) page.

## Governance {#68ee4d5375594154b7f930f3ec0d6a17}

#### Whitelist And/or Blacklist Token Transfers Proposal {#45cfb0e749524b7292eb421de9702f07}


The `proposal-update-tokens-blackwhite` CLI can be used by accounts with permission 24 to create a proposal for adding or modifying whitelist or blacklist tokens. To vote on the proposal, an account must have permission 25. The `--is_add` flag specifies whether the token should be added (`true`) or removed (`false`) from the list, while the `--is_blacklist` flag specifies which list to update (`true` for blacklist, `false` for whitelist).


**Flags**

- `$TITLE`: The title of the proposal.
- `$DESCRIPTION`: The description of the proposal, which can be a URL, text, etc.
- `$TOKENS`: A token or a comma-separated list of tokens (e.g., `ATOM, KEX, BTC`).
- `$ISBLACKLIST`: Boolean value; `true` to add/modify blacklist, `false` for whitelist.
- `$ISADD`: Boolean value; `true` to add, `false` to remove from the list.

```shell
sekaid tx tokens proposal-update-tokens-blackwhite \
--from=$SIGNER $FLAGS_TX \
--title=$TITLE --description=$DESCRIPTION \
--is_add=$ISADD --is_blacklist=$ISBLACKLIST --tokens=$TOKENS
```
