SEKAI 世界 (せかい) - is KIRA’s blockchain application responsible for all on-chain logic such as processing transactions and state transitions. SEKAI is executed by specialized node operators called consensus nodes a.k.a “Validators” who individually propose new blocks and together agree on the correctness of each new block in accordance with the SEKAI codebase. In short, all logic relevant to the block propagation and networking is handled by [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) while all application logic is handled by SEKAI (`sekaid`).
