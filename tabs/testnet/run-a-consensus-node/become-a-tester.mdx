To ensure our network's security, Sybil-resistance is essential. Therefore, all our testers undergo rigorous screening to verify their uniqueness. Our testers are not just testers; they are acknowledged as official KIRA [Evangelists](ecosystem/). **This stasus provides them with benefits such as grants, bounties, potential validator seats, governance roles, and Universal Basic Income (UBI)**. They also gain access to the exclusive [private testers chat](https://testers.kira.network/) and more.


On the mainnet, a dedicated governance body can identify non-Sybil operators without the need for Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols or any other form of personal identification. It's important to note that there is no limit to the number of validators on either the testnet or the mainnet.
