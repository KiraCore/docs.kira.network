Welcome to the KIRA Testnet guide. This document provides essential information on how to participate in the KIRA Testnet. KIRA focuses on testing its core functionalities, including decentralized infrastructure, a consensus network, and a data availability service. The testnet will undergo frequent updates and may experience instability as new features are integrated. We invite developers to contribute to the KIRA ecosystem and encourage users to explore its functionalities, helping us identify and resolve potential design and implementation issues. Node operators are also encouraged to participate by deploying and maintaining validator nodes to ensure network stability.


Participation in the KIRA Testnet offers various opportunities depending on your interests and expertise. Developers can experiment with decentralized applications, leveraging KIRA's hypermodular framework to build and test innovative solutions. Users can engage with the platform to understand its capabilities and provide valuable feedback. Node operators play a crucial role in network maintenance by integrating validator nodes and ensuring seamless operation. By collaborating in these different capacities, all participants can help refine the KIRA network, paving the way for a robust and resilient decentralized ecosystem.


Join us in this exciting journey to build a next-generation network that redefines the possibilities of decentralized applications. Your participation and feedback are invaluable in helping us create a more secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform.
