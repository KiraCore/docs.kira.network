## Concept {#ebfaaf65269241b9a32a9bfeea35b3c8}


KIRA Network utilizes a unique set of on-chain variables known as Network Properties to help control and regulate various behaviors and characteristics of the SEKAI application on a network-wide basis. These parameters serve as the operational gears of the system, allowing for the adjustment of pivotal features such as KEX inflation rate, the minimum transaction fee for any on-chain message to ensure global transaction spam protection, or even the required minimum percentage of governance members necessary to vote on a proposal, making it valid. Such versatility is particularly beneficial, considering the ever-evolving needs of the community and the potential alterations in the network's operational dynamics. Any changes to these network properties require consensus from the network's governance, ensuring that any alterations align with the wishes of the majority of network participants.


## Parameters {#6b3d949219294d29982ae09b9f70a8ba}


All network properties and their respective default values (which can also be found [here](https://github.com/KiraCore/sekai/blob/master/proto/kira/gov/network_properties.proto))
