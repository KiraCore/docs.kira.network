A flexible and adaptable governance structure that allows for a diverse range of participants, a.k.a Councilors, to contribute to KIRA decision-making processes. Unique features include a multi-layered approach to roles and permissions and an Identity Registrar allowing users to verify their own or others' profile claims on-chain, fostering Sybil resistance within the network.
