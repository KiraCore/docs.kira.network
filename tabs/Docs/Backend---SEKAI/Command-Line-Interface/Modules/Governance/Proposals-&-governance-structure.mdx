## Concept {#cec5b8b9f4904b3c98c079258d9a4692}


Proposals form the backbone of the governance process within the KIRA Network, empowering selected network members to collectively influence the blockchain application's conduct and make myriad of off-chain decisions.


### Proposing & Voting Rights {#ca1e33b2b3034f5997ca48f9186e1173}


Two types of network participants are empowered to vote on governance proposals:

- **Consensus nodes**: These are individuals who occupy a validator seat and operate nodes that actively generate new blocks.
- **Councilors:** These are non-validator individuals who, having secured a councilor seat, shoulder the responsibility of network governance.

Together, consensus nodes and councilors constitute the governance set. Inclusion in the governance set doesn't inherently grant the ability to vote on every proposal type. Each governance member necessitates a specific permission to vote on a certain type of proposal. The same principle holds for the creation of new proposals—a specific permission enabling the submission of certain proposals is essential. Permissions can be granted on an individual basis or via roles. This model facilitates an almost infinitely scalable governance system. It allows for the creation of multiple governance sub-councils that can maintain a codependent relationship through [checks and balances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers#Checks_and_balances) or any other governance system. This efficient division of responsibilities enables KIRA governance to manage various on-chain parameters, staking interest rates, and more, concurrently. More details on this can be found in the [Roles & Permissions](/docs/980ceb2f-9bc1-4133-aad0-bfb8a5c55536) section.


### Permissioned Governance Set With Equitable Vote Distribution {#59c3610b51824c349b62a8d93925a7ea}


KIRA's governance structure aims to promotes a non-sybil community—i.e identifiable individuals who cannot own multiple KIRA accounts with the same or different governance permissions. This non-sybil status is curated by the governance set itself, hence termed “permissionned” or “governance curated” governance set. While **members do not need to disclose their identity or undergo KYC procedures**, they must be identifiable individual entities. This is primarily achieved through KIRA’s [Identity Registrar](/docs/d482180d-165a-4c09-8c32-167f061ceb92), which enables all KIRA users to claim and validate various type of information on-chain. Additionally, the governance has various ways to ensure that new members are genuine individuals—like conducting in-person meetings or group calls.


The voting power among governance members is uniformly distributed. Contrary to governance models where token holdings determine voting weight, KIRA provides equal voting weight to all governance members irrespective of their wealth or token ownership. This mitigates the risk of stolen tokens or accounts being used to manipulate network operations or sway governance votes. This becomes crucial in scenarios where centralized custodians, like exchanges holding large token positions of users, can impact other network operations.


### Decision-making Process {#3bc3fc5003d64c968b703fe0f949bd75}


The KIRA Network's decision-making process is orchestrated through the mechanism of proposals. These can be accepted, vetoed, or dismissed by governance members, provided they have the appropriate voting permission. 


This process is guided by the following principles:

- **Voting Eligibility:** Only those network participants who are **validators** or **councilors** (collectively known as [Councilors](/docs/d6f8543a-3b76-44a8-8fab-eeafcef56c8e)) are eligible to vote on proposals.
- **Voting Permission:** Councilors can vote on a specific proposal only if they have been granted the respective permission that allows them to do so or if they possess a role that encompasses said permission.
- **Vote Casting:** Governance actors have the option to cast one of four distinct vote types: `yes (1)`, `abstain (2)`, `no (3)`, or `veto (4)`.
- **Proposal Timeline:** A proposal cannot be accepted, vetoed, or dismissed until its `voting_end_time` time has elapsed. Furthermore, a proposal cannot take effect until the `enactment_end_time` has elapsed. No votes can be cast during the enactment period, and a proposal only comes into effect after this period ends.

:::note

The enactment time allows participants to analyze successful proposal results and act accordingly, avoiding unexpected shifts in voting outcomes.

:::



- **Quorum Requirement:** A proposal necessitates a minimum number of votes, or a quorum, to be considered valid. The quorum is essential for ensuring adequate participation and representation in the decision-making process. Failing to meet the quorum results in the proposal being marked as `QuorumNotReached`.

:::note

The default proposal minimum quorum percentage is 33% and is configurable by governance via the `vote_quorum` [network property](/docs/b9b95792-b936-4603-8a46-15566f24e3c0).

:::




The outcome of a proposal is determined based on the following rules:


| **Outcome**        | **Condition**                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Passed`           | If quorum is reached and more than $1\over 2$ (>50%) of all votes are `yes` votes.                                                                        |
| `Rejected`         | If quorum is reached and votes of a type other than `yes` sum to more than or equal to $1\over 2$ (>=50%) of all votes.                                   |
| `RejectedWithVeto` | If more than or equal to `veto_threshold` (default 33.4%) votes are `veto` votes, the proposal is rejected (a minority of members can reject a proposal). |
| `QuorumNotReached` | The quorum was not reach before `voting_end_time`.                                                                                                        |


#### Relevant Network Properties {#5584c3f171f24ddfa7a616c344690c83}


Two fundamental [network properties](/docs/b9b95792-b936-4603-8a46-15566f24e3c0) establish the baseline for proposal duration and enactment timeframes: `minimum_proposal_end_time` and `proposal_enactment_time`.

- The `minimum_proposal_end_time` sets the lower limit for all proposals durations, also known as `voting_end_time` which can be adjusted by the governance for individual proposal [types](https://github.com/KiraCore/sekai/blob/master/types/Proposal.go).
- The `proposal_enactment_time` creates a consistent rule that applies to all proposals. It sets each proposal's `enactment_end_time` by adding the `proposal_enactment_time` to that proposal's `voting_end_time`.
