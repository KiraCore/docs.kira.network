KIRA's consensus model expands upon Tendermint. It ensures equal block proposal opportunities through a governance-permissioned system. Additionally, its MBPoS system promotes staking of assorted digital assets and advances a native liquid staking feature, offering the ease of staking and trading via derivative tokens for added liquidity.
