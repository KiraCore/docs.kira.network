Staking Collectives offer a community-centric mechanism to pool staking tokens and redirect their dividends. Through Spending Pools, members can lock tokens, reallocating the staking rewards to other network users. The system offers collective control over status, proposals, and changes, with withdrawal limits in place for enhanced protection.
