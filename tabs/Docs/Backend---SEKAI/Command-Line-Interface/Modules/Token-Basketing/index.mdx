Through the functionality of this module users can bundle same-denomination tokens, such as KIRAâ€™s staking derivatives, into a single derivative token, simplifying trades and exchanges within the ecosystem. With the module's fixed weight system, the list of tokens in a basket can change over time, serving not as an exchange but as a risk management tool.
