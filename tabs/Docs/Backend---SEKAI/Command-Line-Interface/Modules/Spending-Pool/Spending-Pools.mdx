### Concept {#bea35ceff8cf4831964d8dcacdcc2131}


Spending pools are KIRA’s native token distribution system, providing a way to distribute a pooled amount of one or multiple tokens to a defined set of accounts at a predefined rate over a specific period. They can operate in two distinct modes for the rate of distribution: a fixed rate mode and a dynamic rate mode, providing flexibility and customization options for different use cases. 


Spending pools are an essential tool for incentivizing network actors such as developers or community managers for their contributions. They are permissionless, allowing any KIRA account to create one and associate it with one or more "owners," which can be governance-defined [roles](/docs/980ceb2f-9bc1-4133-aad0-bfb8a5c55536) or individual KIRA accounts. Accounts that are eligible to claim rewards from the spending pool are called "beneficiaries" and can also be defined as [roles](/docs/980ceb2f-9bc1-4133-aad0-bfb8a5c55536) or individual KIRA accounts. One of the primary use cases for spending pools is the distribution of [Universal Basic Income](/docs/c8f1129d-1fa0-4f24-bc4d-b9fa32b28c0e) to KIRA consensus nodes and governance members. Additionally, they are also utilized by the [Staking Collective](/docs/ae15b99b-2180-4e35-ba7f-fda8331d3557) module as a means to redistribute staking rewards.


### Distribution Rates {#bc3faf0a7e1f49d3a463479ff09db543}


#### Static Mode {#b82e4504d49142d79e5cd93f18439be4}


The spending pool mechanism is straightforward - it consists of a distribution rate and a period. Instead of tracking the exact amount owed to each account over time, it simply keeps track of the last time an account made a claim within the claiming period. This information is sufficient to calculate an account's current entitlement by multiplying the rate by the time elapsed since the last claim. Spending pools can accommodate the distribution of multiple different tokens. Any token can be deposited and their individual distribution `rate` can be accurately set, ensuring that the tokens are distributed as intended over the claiming period. 


:::note

If a token is deposited into the pool but its static rate is not defined, it will not be distributed to any beneficiaries (similar to setting its rate to zero).

:::




#### Dynamic Mode {#93fb4c6d308d4de59a568efa813ab790}


The dynamic token rate mechanism, enabled by the `dynamic-rate` field, allows for the proper distribution of tokens over the claiming period, even when the amount of tokens deposited within that period is unpredictable or fluctuates, which would otherwise require continuous rate adjustments. If `dynamic-rate` is set to `false`, the spending pool operates in the static `rate` mode. When it is enabled, the `dynamic-rate-period` field determines how often the token rates are recalculated, measured in seconds (Unix). 


In this mode, rates of distribution are re-adjusted at the end of each `dynamic-rate-period` to ensure the complete allocation of pooled funds by the conclusion of the subsequent period. Therefore, any fund contributions made to the pool after the rate recalibration will effectively be accounted for in the following period. For beneficiaries, it is essential to make a claim at least once within the current `dynamic-rate-period`, and ideally at its closure in order to get the full entitlement; beneficiaries who fail to claim their due rewards within a dynamic period effectively forfeit their share (or remaining share) for that period, which is then redistributed in the next period's calculations. It also implies that beneficiaries who register cannot claim the on-goin period and must wait until the next one to starts before doing so and effectively receive tokens from the pool. The [**Staking Collectives**](/docs/ae15b99b-2180-4e35-ba7f-fda8331d3557) module is an example of where this mechanism is necessary, as it works in conjunction with the Spending Pool module to redistribute staking rewards, which are unpredictable by nature.


### Claiming Period {#2578c5f2c4274f91a73d4345613f14b3}


The simplicity of the spending pool mechanism also allows for flexibility in claiming. Unlike traditional wage systems where one typically has to wait until the end of a specific period (usually a month) to receive their earnings, with a spending pool, an account can claim multiple times within the defined claiming period. This allows for a more dynamic and responsive distribution of funds, catering to the needs of the beneficiaries while still ensuring that the tokens are being distributed properly. The `claim-start` and `claim-end` parameters define the claiming period during which tokens can be claimed from the pool, providing a precise and transparent system for all parties involved. 


:::note

`claim-end` can be set to `0` to indicate that there is no predetermined end date for the claiming period, allowing beneficiaries to claim their rewards until the spending pool’s funds are fully distributed.

:::




#### Claiming Process {#1d5663efe31c473c82a5cc536146d828}


To request funds from a spending pool, a beneficiary must be registered. The beneficiary can then send a transaction to request the funds they are entitled to receive. There are several conditions that must be met in order for the funds to be distributed:

- The current block time must be within the period defined by the `claim-start` and `claim-end` properties.
- The spending pool must have a sufficient balance. If the pool does not have enough funds, pooled token will not be sent in any amount. If the pool has sufficient funds, the exact amount owed will be sent to the beneficiary.
- If the claiming period or the dynamic claim period has elapsed and the funds have not been claimed by the beneficiary they are forfeited.

If all of these conditions are met, the funds will be distributed to the beneficiary.


### Claim Expiry {#8af04c0644d040dba74ca7bcd8239fda}


The `claim-expiry` parameter sets a critical window within which beneficiaries are required to claim their rewards, preserving the integrity of reward calculations amid potential rate changes over time. Should a beneficiary not engage within this window, rewards succeeding the deadline are excluded from subsequent claim calculation. This mechanism ensures that rewards are accurately and fairly distributed even if pool owners operates rate changes, and it underscores the importance of regular claims to secure entitled benefits. Beneficiaries must therefore remain proactive in claiming within each designated period to uphold the system's equitable distribution of rewards


:::note

The [`proposal-distribute-spending-pool`](/docs/812fdf31-d225-4daf-a4cd-4501cbc00d95) command enables the spending pool’s owners to enforce funds distribution. This command is particularly useful before modifying the fixed distribution rate to avoid misdistribution.

:::




### Distribution Weights {#4686819c6f3d438db3d2c7f09ce4898d}


Individual token distribution rates can be set for specific accounts and/or roles using [weights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean). For example, if a specific account's or a [role](/docs/980ceb2f-9bc1-4133-aad0-bfb8a5c55536)’s `weight` is set to `2`, it will receive tokens at 2x the base rate (static or dynamic) compared to other accounts. Weights can also be decimal values, such as `0.5`, which will reduce the token rate for the associated account or role by half. All distribution rates are set to `1` by default.


It's worth noting that any changes made to the weights of registered beneficiaries will result in the recalculation of global token rates, ensuring that the modified rate for one account does not impact the entitlements of others. This means for instance that if the weight for an account is increased, the global rate is increased accordingly, rather than decreasing the entitlements for every other account. This mechanism makes sense from an HR management standpoint, as it allows for proper management of wages among different members of a community or team, ensuring that each person is compensated fairly for their contributions.

The operation and parameters of a spending pool is controlled through custom proposals that can only be raised and voted on by the pool's owners. Any KIRA account can create a spending pool and seed it with funds, becoming the first owner in the list. The owner of the spending pool can then assign additional owners, define the rules of the pool's operation, and designate beneficiaries who can claim the pooled tokens.
