Spending Pool, a native token distribution system in KIRA, allows for token allocation to specified accounts at a set rate and duration. It functions in two modes - fixed and dynamic, to cater to different needs. An open-door policy enables anyone to create a pool, facilitating tokens for network contributors like developers and community managers. Owners govern pool parameters, while beneficiaries are entitled to claim the tokens
