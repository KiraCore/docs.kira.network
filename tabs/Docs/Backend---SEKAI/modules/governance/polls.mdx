## Concept {#4a059df6e57742028ba3441c9e5b0abd}


Signaling proposals are a typical practice in blockchain governance activities. They provide a means for the community to gauge sentiment or reach consensus on a particular issue or suggestion without necessitating changes to the blockchain's state. However, these proposals simplify multifaceted issues into binary 'yes/no' votes, potentially distorting the accurate representation of varied community perspectives on complex issues. Additionally, they may slow down decision-making and introduce inefficiency to the overall governance process. Such potential drawbacks have led some projects, such as Ethereum and Celestia, to favor off-chain governance, a shift that arguably contradicts the decentralization principle.


Because of KIRA network's [unique governance ranking system](/docs/d6f8543a-3b76-44a8-8fab-eeafcef56c8e), the inclusion of signaling proposals adds another layer of complexity, potentially skewing the decision-making process as votes could be influenced more by score preservation than by authentic opinions. To circumvent these challenges, KIRA network introduces the Poll module, which offers a more inclusive and flexible mechanism for consensus. Unlike traditional signaling proposals, a Poll Proposal allows a select group of individuals to either present their own voting options or vote on pre-existing ones. This approach caters to a wide array of use cases and fosters a more accurate reflection of the diverse interests across various scenarios, such as agreeing on upgrade timeframes, selecting group administrators, or deciding on future changes to the network properties registrar.


### Proposing & Voting Rights {#5cba6ad7964f4ecca8e5dcf67be3762b}


For any users to initiate a Poll, the necessary permission, represented by the 66[broken link], must be directly assigned to their account or embedded within a Role associated with their account. This permission is automatically granted to [Councilors](/docs/d6f8543a-3b76-44a8-8fab-eeafcef56c8e) upon claiming their Councillor Seat. Contrary to KIRA [Proposals](/docs/25d26925-50ce-4a4f-836b-fc8486ef8b05), Polls do not have a corresponding voting permission. Rather, the user submitting the proposal determines which [roles](/docs/980ceb2f-9bc1-4133-aad0-bfb8a5c55536) can vote on the particular Poll by setting up a whitelist.


### Decision-making Process {#25e477b20c7d417eb03cec979abace5d}


The decision-making process for the Poll module operates in line with the principles established by the [Proposals logic](/docs/25d26925-50ce-4a4f-836b-fc8486ef8b05), while accommodating the unique requirements of this module. This process is guided by the following key points:

- **Voting Eligibility:** All whitelisted roles can cast a vote per poll. This vote can be changed later on by sending another voting transaction.
- **Vote Options:** A single vote can correspond to one or many voting options, as outlined by the `options.choices` variable.
- **Custom Choices:** Voters are permitted to cast custom choices if the `options.count` exceeds the `options.values.length`. Such custom choices are subsequently added to `options.values`, enabling other users to vote on them. However, each voter can only cast a vote for a specific option once.
- **Abstain and Veto:** Regardless of the defined `options.values`, voters are allowed to vote `abstain` or `veto`. These are reserved values and don't have to match the `options.type`.
- **Proposal Timeline:** Poll proposals do not have an enactment time. A proposal can neither pass, be rejected, nor vetoed before its `voting_end_time` time has elapsed, unless all eligible voters have cast their votes and the result is decisive.
- **Quorum Requirement:** A poll necessitates a minimum number of votes, or a quorum, to be considered valid. The quorum is essential for ensuring adequate participation and representation in the decision-making process.

:::note

The poll minimum quorum percentage is the same as the proposal quorum, 33% by default and is configurable by governance via the `vote_quorum` [network property](/docs/b9b95792-b936-4603-8a46-15566f24e3c0).

The outcome of a Poll proposal is determined based on the following rules:


| **Outcome**        | **Condition**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Passed`           | If quorum is reached and more than $1\over 2$ (>50%) of all votes are for any `Custom` options or `Abstain`.                                                                                                                                  |
| `Rejected`         | If quorum is reached and there is a tie for the highest vote count between two or more options (indicating an indecisive result), or if the sum of `Abstain` and `NoWithVeto` votes is more than or equal to $1\over 2$ (>=50%) of all votes. |
| `RejectedWithVeto` | More than or equal to `veto_threshold` percentage of votes are veto.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `QuorumNotReached` | `vote_quorum` was not reached before the end of the poll.                                                                                                                                                                                     |


### Other Relevant Network Properties {#d0c478a7d18c4ce690d835ed6fba620c}


The following [network properties](/docs/b9b95792-b936-4603-8a46-15566f24e3c0) establish limits over some of the Poll parameters:

- The `max_proposal_poll_option_size` denotes the maximum character size of an individual Poll option and is set at `64` by default.
- The `max_proposal_poll_option_count` sets the maximum number of custom options a Poll can have and is set at `128` by default.
- The `max_proposal_reference_size` is used to indicate the maximum reference size in the poll and has a default value set at `512`.
- The `max_proposal_checksum_size` represents the maximum checksum size in the poll and is set to default at `128`.
