The Auth module in KIRA extends the functionality of the Cosmos SDK's `auth` module, focusing on validating and processing transactions within the network. It utilizes a set of `AnteDecorators` to perform basic transaction validity checks before they are included in the blockchain. These checks involve verifying signatures, ensuring correct nonces, and validating auxiliary fields. The Auth module is also responsible for managing accounts, including their creation, storage, and querying, as well as maintaining associated account information.


KIRA enriches the standard handlers by introducing custom decorators tailored to its network requirements such as custody rules, poor network conditions and token whitelist/blacklist enforcement.. One key area is fee processing; since KIRA does not have a concept of gas fees, it implements specific decorators for this purpose. More information on KIRA's fee processing can be found in the [Fee processing](/docs/184c11ed-4849-4ec5-acd0-f795b7abf467) module.
