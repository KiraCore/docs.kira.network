The Upgrade Module plays a crucial role in ensuring seamless transitions between different versions of the KIRA Network while preserving the current chain state. KIRA's governance is responsible for managing the upgrade process with permissions to propose and vote on the "Upgrade Plan". The Upgrade Plan is a set of JSON-formatted instructions hosted on-chain that details how and when validators should proceed with the upgrade. Additionally, the Upgrade Module offers a unique feature that informs new network participants about the necessary software resources to join the network, thereby ensuring the process of acquiring essential references and checksums is entirely trustless.
