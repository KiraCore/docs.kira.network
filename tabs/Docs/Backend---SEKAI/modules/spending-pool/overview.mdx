The Spending Pool Module, a native token distribution mechanism in KIRA, allows for creation of spending pools for token allocation to specified accounts at a set rate and duration. They function in two modes - fixed and dynamic, each catering to different needs. An open-door policy enables anyone to create a pool, facilitating tokens for network contributors like developers and community managers. Owners govern pool parameters, while beneficiaries are entitled to claim the tokens.
