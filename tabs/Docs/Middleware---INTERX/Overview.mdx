INTERX - "Interchain NginX", is a decentralized API and Content Availability Layer that enables access to the state of blockchain applications and L2 without relying on any third-party service providers. Decentralized middleware makes it easier to build frontend applications and eliminates the need for difficult-to-maintain light clients. Its main functions are distributed applications proxy, load balancer, replicated storage, and security gateway service for communication between the backend and front end. INTERX requires access to both the GRPC and the Tendermint RPC endpoint ([`Tendermint RPC`](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/)) of SEKAI node.
