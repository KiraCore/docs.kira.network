RYOKAI 了解 (りょかい), previously known as KIRA Manager, is KIRA’s orchestration tool, a physical infrastructure manager that facilitates backend operations of KIRA stack components for Consensus nodes. It automates critical processes such as SEKAI system upgrades, auto-deployment of containerized Layer 2 applications, and INTERX configuration.


RYOKAI facilitates the initialization and management of nodes via a built-in terminal, which permits the direct execution of commands on remote hosts. Additionally, it offers cross-platform support, enabling Consensus nodes to manage their ‘validator’ accounts on Android, iOS, and Linux devices. These features provide operators with the flexibility to access and control their infrastructure from any location, at any time. For monitoring, RYOKAI eliminates the need for additional computer systems by incorporating Prometheus exporters and the standard Tendermint endpoint (:26660). These tools collect and relay operational data, providing Consensus nodes with a detailed understanding of network health and performance without relying on traditional monitoring infrastructure. Additionally, RYOKAI improves network security through firewall configurations, ssh key management, and encrypted communication channels to prevent unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.
