## Staking Rewards {#a63d9225f2ad4a229025a0fdfba77c92}


:::note

For a better understanding regarding network rewards distribution, please refer to the [Fees and staking rewards distribution](/docs/85d4757d-f36d-4a39-b7ab-62866c1689ba) section.

:::




KIRA’s Consensus nodes earn trifold rewards: **block rewards, fee rewards, and RollApp incentives.** They are distributed in slightly different ways but follow a simple generic pattern. They are awarded per block. The selected block proposer first takes a commission before the remainder is shared among its respective delegators who have entrusted their assets to the Consensus nodes to participate in Consensus on their behalf. 

- <u>Block rewards</u> are a fixed amount of KEX tokens minted in each block — shared between delegators according to the total value of all the tokens they have delegated among all active staking pools. **Hence, block rewards compensate delegators proportionally to the risk they are taking network-wise** — this is similar to Cosmos reward distribution.
- <u>Fee rewards</u> are a portion of the [execution fees](/docs/184c11ed-4849-4ec5-acd0-f795b7abf467) paid by users for each transactions shared between its delegators according to their share of the staking pool. **Hence, fee rewards only compensate delegators proportionally to the risk they are taking locally** — this is similar to Polkadot reward distribution. Note that fee rewards are not limited to KEX and can also include a variety of different tokens that are whitelisted for fee payment. The composition of the rewards basket may vary based on the type and volume of activity conducted on the network.

## Rollapp Incentives {#f5729db77406472a86817be36ff4dd9f}


A portion of the swap fees generated by the AMM pool of any RollApp will be paid to Consensus nodes serving as active Executors and Verifiers for said RollApp, and by extension their delegators. dApp deployers may choose to offer additional incentives for Consensus nodes to serve as the execution layer for these RollApp. **Application incentives are paid in similar fashion to fee rewards.** 


## Auxiliary Rewards {#2c07de1a942a4fe18e1c7457e24525e5}


In addition, KIRA has two subsidiary sources of extrinsic rewards which are more circumstantial:  

- <u>Universal Basic Income</u> (from KEX inflation) — The [Universal Basic Income](/docs/c8f1129d-1fa0-4f24-bc4d-b9fa32b28c0e) module allows to create various incentivization schemes for a specific network purposes (e.g. increasing block rewards if the network security subsidy becomes too low), or a specific role (e.g. community managers).
- <u>Stake grants</u> (from KIRA’s treasury)  — Winners of the incentivized games will be allocated some amount of <u>staked</u> KEX from the treasury to help them bootstrapping their nodes.
