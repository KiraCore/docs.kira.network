## For Developers {#11e467da57b780348e77f7163391a67a}


KIRA offers developers unparalleled flexibility and simplicity, mirroring the familiar deployment process of Web2 cloud services like AWS. Applications are virtualized in Docker containers and executed by Consensus nodes, allowing developers to use any programming language they prefer. This approach combines the ease of Web2 deployment with the decentralized benefits of Web3. The Virtual Finality Gadget (VFG) enables custom finality rules for deterministic and non-deterministic verifiable applications, supporting next-gen blockchain-less and resource-heavy use cases like AI, streaming, and gaming. KIRA's decentralized infrastructure provides customizable hardware resources (CPU, GPU, etc.) with specific allocation based on application needs. The integrated decentralized API (INTERX) eliminates reliance on external providers for RPC, execution, or data availability, simplifying the transition from Web2 to Web3 by offering familiar API interfaces. KIRA's hypermodular design features out-of-the-box support for sequencing, data availability, application hosting, middleware, proxy, load balancing, and caching of user requests, allowing developers to focus solely on their core application logic without the complexities of blockchain integration or infrastructure management.


## For Users {#11e467da57b78083a83bd714109cb89c}


KIRA prioritizes user accessibility and security. Users can become Fishermen (Verifiers) for their preferred RollApps with minimal self-hosted hardware cost. Users can define custom rules of app auditing (verification) or inherit default rules provided by app developers to protect applications against potential exploits. This participatory model enhances overall application security by making it unpredictable for attackers to know whether or not their often very costly attack will succeed. The Initial Liquidity Offering model ensures that launched applications meet user demand and have sufficient token liquidity. All RollApps inherit base-layer security, as only Consensus nodes can become Executors to run the RollApp's code. KIRA's support for native Liquid Staking Derivatives enables any token to participate in restaking, matching the security of user deposits from external networks while preserving liquidity. This innovative model aligns incentives among users, developers, Executors, and Fishermen (Verifiers), fostering the creation of high-quality RollApps. By enabling all stakeholders to participate in and benefit from the success of applications, KIRA creates a robust ecosystem that encourages continuous improvement and innovation. This approach enhances the overall quality of applications and ensures a more engaged and invested community, driving the long-term growth and sustainability of the KIRA network.


## For Node Operators (consensus Nodes) {#11e467da57b78044975ddf917bfa0914}


KIRA provides node operators with a flexible and accessible system. Operators can choose which RollApp(s) to support and independently scale their hardware resources to meet specific requirements. This flexibility allows participation at various levels, from individuals with minimal resources validating SEKAI from within the home environment to more resource-intensive and higher yield-bearing operations supporting multiple RollApps. The RYOKAI is KIRA's DevOps all-in-one solution, significantly lowering the technical barrier to entry by automating many operational tasks. The hypermodular design offers out-of-the-box support for middleware (INTERX), proxying, caching, autoscaling, and infrastructure management (RYOKAI), allowing hardware providers to focus solely on supplying highly available resources without years of experience. This accessibility, combined with modest hardware requirements, maximizes network decentralization while providing opportunities for operators to contribute meaningfully to KIRA's security and growth.
