If you were among the 63 nodes from chaosnet-1[broken link], your seat is reserved—no extra steps needed. Navigate to the _Node Info_ section, the _Claim Validator Seat_ button will appear after some time. Click and enter your moniker. If the button doesn’t disappear, either the transaction failed, or the update hasn’t processed yet.


If you weren’t part of chaosnet-1, please check out the [Evangelist program](/srcpages/resources/evangelist) to secure your validator seat.
