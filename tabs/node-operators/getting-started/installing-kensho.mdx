## Prerequisites {#127467da57b780cb8462ec8970164c12}


Before proceeding, please ensure that you meet the [minimum system & software requirements](/node-operators/getting-started/system-requirements) to operate a node. If these requirements are met, you should be able to launch a Consensus node (a.k.a Validator node) and other types of KIRA nodes in a home environment, even using off-the-shelf single-board computers like a Raspberry Pi. There are no slashing penalties for Consensus node going offline or becoming temporarily inaccessible. Nodes that remain offline for an extended period will become `inactivate` and be automatically removed from the consensus by the state machine, [SEKAI](/docs/backend---sekai/overview). For more details on enforcement rules, see [Jailing & Slashing Procedures](/docs/backend---sekai/modules/slashing/jailing--slashing-procedures) and for the rank-based uptime system, refer to [Consensus Nodes Ranking & Status Management](/docs/backend---sekai/modules/slashing/consensus-nodes-ranking--status-management). 


The network is designed to halt if â‰¥ 1/3 of consensus nodes suddenly become unresponsive. However, if individual nodes randomly leave and enter the consensus, there should be no interruption to network operation. As long as the number of validators doesn't fall below `min_validators` (as defined in [Network Properties](/docs/backend---sekai/modules/governance/network-properties)), the chain will continue producing new blocks. For more details on the network's behavior in such cases, see [Poor Network Conditions](/docs/backend---sekai/modules/governance/poor-network-conditions).


## Downloading and Installing Kensho {#127467da57b78066beeece4931fd21ad}


Using KENSHO is the quickest way to run your node on the KIRA Network. KENSHO is a user-friendly Consensus node operator interface that replaces the deprecated Kira Manager 1.0 (a.k.a KM1). It allows you to easily deploy infrastructure, launch a full node, and claim a Consensus node seat on both the testnet and mainnet. Once you're comfortable with the process, you can refer to our [public documentation page](https://docs.kira.network/) for more detailed information on how to use SEKAI and INTERX.


Currently, KENSHO supports Windows and Linux (Debian-based distributions). A MacOS version will be added soon, but can be built using [Fyne](https://docs.fyne.io/started/cross-compiling.html) for those who need it immediately. We also have plans to release an Android version in the future.
