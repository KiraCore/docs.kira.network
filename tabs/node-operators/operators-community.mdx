Regardless of your decision to join our validator community, KIRA extends a warm welcome to all who wish to join our open and public network. To start your journey, simply install our validator or sentry node software, available on our [GitHub](https://git.kira.network/). Alternatively, you can download our infrastructure management tool, KIRA Manager or KENSHO. We invite everyone with a passion for decentralized systems and fundamental freedoms to explore KIRA and discover its ability to run and secure the next generation of web3 apps.

To ensure our network's security, Sybil-resistance is essential. Therefore, all our Consensus nodes operators undergo rigorous screening to verify their uniqueness. Our operators are acknowledged as official KIRA [Evangelists](/src/pages/resources/evangelist). **This status provides them with benefits such as grants, bounties, governance roles, and** [**Universal Basic Income**](/docs/backend---sekai/modules/universal-basic-income/universal-basic-income). They also gain access to the exclusive [private validator chat](https://testers.kira.network/) and more.


On the mainnet, a dedicated governance body can identify non-Sybil operators without the need for Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols or any other form of personal identification. It's important to note that there is no limit to the number of validators on either the testnet or the mainnet.
