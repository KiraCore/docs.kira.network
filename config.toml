## Individual Page Settings ##
# the [pages] table defines override settings for individual pages, by defining
# a sub-table named after the page url (or part of the url, but careful about
# not using a string that appears in multiple page urls)
[pages]
  # Page Roles-Permissions
  # This page uses a database to store permissions. Permissions are backlinked throughout the documentation 
  # therefore "no-links" might actually not work here because of necessity to create the permission's page for all exisiting backlinks.
  #[pages.1cde3b7e9e7a4734a0e9981f2014447a]
